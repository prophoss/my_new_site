I will be starting school soon. I will be going to devry university here in DFW area. The first classes will start in january. These are 8 week classes. I'll be taking two at a time. I hope I can keep up. I watched the online orietation and it was good, but I won't truley get used to using the online class site until I use it a while. That's just the way it goes usualy. Still I'm excited to get going again! I am a bit worried, but excited and hopeful all the same.
