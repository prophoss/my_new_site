Well this will be my blog page, I hope.  
It's been kind of a long journey to figure out where and how to do things. I finally settled on [*hugo*](https://gohugo.io/) to set all this up. I was never really sure how exactly to all this. I learned about [*html*](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and [*css*](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) but didn't really understand how to make it all work togther. I was asking questions about using some of the python web framework like [*flask*](http://flask.pocoo.org/) or [*django*](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Someone suggested a static website creator. Ok whats that? Capt. google to the rescue. After much reading and watching youtube videos I found gatsby which I found very interesting, but after watching a few tutorial videos all I got was more confused. Ok what else is out there. Well there is Jeckyl and hugo. I'll check out hugo first. I watched the youtube tutorials by [*girrafe academy*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw) and these made sense. The way it was laid out and the tutorial it's self was easier to underatnd. Ok I can deal with this. So here I am setting up a good website for my personal learning blog.
